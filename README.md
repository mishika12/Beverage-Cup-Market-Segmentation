###  Beverage-Cup-Market-Segmentation


### <ins> Introduction   
This project focuses on segmenting customers of a beverage cup product using both affinity-based and classical (K-means) clustering approaches. The goal is to develop detailed customer personas and make product recommendations for each identified segment.   

### <ins> Problem Statement    
The primary challenge is to effectively segment a diverse customer base using clustering methods. The project involves two key approaches:    

> Affinity-Based Segmentation: Leveraging customer preferences, demographic data, and purchase probabilities to create segments that reflect strong affinities toward the product. The goal is to identify the most defining characteristics of each segment and develop personas that represent these customer groups.   

> Classical K-means Segmentation: Implementing K-means clustering to group customers based on their preference parameters. The objective is to determine the optimal number of clusters and profile each segment using demographic information, allowing for the development of personas that guide product recommendations.
