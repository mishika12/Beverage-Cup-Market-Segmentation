###  Beverage-Cup-Market-Segmentation


### <ins> Introduction   
This project focuses on segmenting customers of a beverage cup product using both affinity-based and classical (K-means) clustering approaches. The goal is to develop detailed customer personas and make product recommendations for each identified segment.   

### <ins> Problem Statement    
The primary challenge is to effectively segment a diverse customer base using clustering methods. The project involves two key approaches:    

• Affinity-Based Segmentation: Leveraging customer preferences, demographic data, and purchase probabilities to create segments that reflect strong affinities toward the product. The goal is to identify the most defining characteristics of each segment and develop personas that represent these customer groups.   

• Classical K-means Segmentation: Implementing K-means clustering to group customers based on their preference parameters. The objective is to determine the optimal number of clusters and profile each segment using demographic information, allowing for the development of personas that guide product recommendations.    


### <ins> Methodology

The dataset contains customer preference parameters, demographic information, and purchase probabilities for various beverage cup features. The project employs both affinity-based and classical clustering techniques to segment customers and develop personas.

#### Affinity-Based Segmentation:

• Data Utilization
• Feature Analysis
• Persona Creation: Develop personas by analyzing log-lifts of key attributes within each segment, providing insights into the most distinctive traits of each group.


#### Classical K-means Segmentation:

• Clustering Basis
• Segment Profiling
• Persona Development
